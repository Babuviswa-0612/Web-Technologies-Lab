    <p>A camera functions by controlling light through a lens, directing it onto a sensor or film to capture images. Essential parts include the lens, aperture, shutter, and image sensor. Cameras have evolved significantly, transitioning from film-based 
    systems to digital technologies, which offer superior image quality, storage, and ease of use. Modern cameras boast features like autofocus, image stabilization, and digital processing, making photography more accessible and versatile. 
    This technological advancement has revolutionized both professional and consumer photography, enhancing creativity and convenience.</p>
